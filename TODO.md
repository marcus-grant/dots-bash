TODOs
=====

- [ ] Split functions into categorized files
- [ ] Include [`keychain`](https://www.funtoo.org/Keychain) to manage ssh keys once per reboot

Planning
========

- [ ] Consider removing python powerline prompt stuff
- [ ] Figure out how to properly split one time exports into other files
    - .profile seems to be at least one of the correct places
    - .bash_profile then has some complications, investigate
- [ ] Consider removing go-prompt stuff
    - It might be faster with all the features I want, do some profiling 1st


Complete
========

- [x] Add TODOs.md `5fd9aa2`
