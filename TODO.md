TODOs
=====

- [ ] fif() find-in-file with preview using rg from [this](http://bit.ly/2L7PIhi)
    - Consider adding a function that uses `fif` that uses MY_NOTES_DIR or MY_CODE_DIR
- [ ] Split functions into categorized files
- [ ] Include [`keychain`](https://www.funtoo.org/Keychain) to manage ssh keys once per reboot

Planning
========

- [ ] Add as many of [these](http://bit.ly/2L7PIhi) as possible
- [ ] Consider removing python powerline prompt stuff
- [ ] Figure out how to properly split one time exports into other files
    - .profile seems to be at least one of the correct places
    - .bash_profile then has some complications, investigate
- [ ] Consider removing go-prompt stuff
    - It might be faster with all the features I want, do some profiling 1st
- blah


Complete
========

- [x] $MY_CODE_DIR export
- [x] Add TODOs.md `5fd9aa2`
